# Programmatic SEO using CrackedDevs API and LLMs

Have you ever searched "Software Engineer Salaries" on Google?

Major job boards like Glassdoor and Indeed use programmatic SEO for generating aggregated reports in bulk, and they rank very well on Google.

I bet you clicked one of their programmatic pages at least once in your life, and know what I'm talking about. Those pages are useful for the users, and they generate free traffic for the job boards.


In our journey, we will:
- Get data from the CrackedDevs API.
- Process the data to make it suitable for our project.
- Cluster the data together using LLMs.
- Generate human-friendly unique templates using LLMs.
- Dynamically populate the templates and generate Programmatic SEO pages for CrackedDevs.

You may run the code using Google Colab **Please edit the API KEY variables**:
